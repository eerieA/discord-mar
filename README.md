# Discord Mark-as-Read per server

Got tired of pressing *shift+Esc* on PC every now and then, so made an easier version of it as a Chrome extension. This may violate Discord's TOS so is hosted here. Not tested on MacOS.

⚠️May break without notice.

## Version

Works for `stable 397720 (d46a552) Build.`

## Installation

1. Download this repo as zip, or download the release.
2. Unzip it.
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Enable "Developer mode" (top right).
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder.
6. Reload your Discord web app if was open before.
